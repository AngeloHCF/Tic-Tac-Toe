I love using canva because it forces you to use math, and I believe math is the fundamental core of programming. Although, Tic Tac Toe isn't a hard game to program, I had plenty of fun creating this. I love playing video games -->
and so the act of me trying to learn, master, and force myself to use shortcuts reminds me of learning hotkeys in a video game.
